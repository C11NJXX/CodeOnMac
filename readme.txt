This is a readme file
And it is the first time that I use git to make a reprosiroty in my MacBook
Hello Mac! Hello git!
--This is a simple line-
--This is an another line--
--No need to tell this is the third line--
I add a branch named c11njxx and now I'm update readme.txt on this branch
I use switch instead of checkout -b to make a branch and update this file
do you think i can still be here when the complict has been fixed?
